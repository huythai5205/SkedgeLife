            <CardPanel className="grey lighten-3 black-text">
              <p>SkedgeLife is designed with the independent business in mind. We believe that if you have a skill or service, you should be able to share it easily!
                In a world of student loans and overpriced degrees, you shouldn't need to go into debt to learn a new skill or trade.
                Similarly, why pay too much for services when you can go direct to the source? With SkedgeLife, you can find someone directly
            to assist with you with a home repair or service and read their reviews. Need a logo or website? No problem! Find someone local who can help!</p>
              <p>What if you have a number of different skills or services your provide?
              This where our App can be very handy! Many of us are yoga teachers, fitness instructors, hair stylists, massage therapists...
              You could be working from multiple locations, including several businesses along with your own private clients. In many industries it is frowned upon
              to promote your other services or locations from one business to the next. At SkedgeLife we say no way! Put all of your schedules and services in one place,
              and allow your students, clients, and followers to sign up and pay you directly through the App. You could even setup a workshop, seminar, or retreat,
              or take recurring or monthly payments for ongoing business.</p>
